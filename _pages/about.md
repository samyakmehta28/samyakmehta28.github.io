Hello!

I am a passionate software engineer and researcher with a strong academic and professional background. Currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu), where I maintain a perfect 4.0 GPA, I previously earned my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), ranking second in my department. My expertise lies in full-stack development, API gateway configuration, and machine learning.

My professional journey includes impactful internships at Coherent Corp. and Adobe. At Coherent, I developed an AI assistant for their ecosystem using OpenAI and the Angular-Node.js stack. At Adobe, I designed a patented pipeline to enhance multimodal documents using NLP and image retrieval. I have served as a Teaching Assistant for Python and Data Science courses, which allowed me to apply my technical knowledge while honing my communication skills.
