Hello!

As a highly motivated aspiring software engineer with a passion for innovation, I thrive on building cutting-edge solutions that drive real impact. With a solid academic background forged at the esteemed [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) for my bachelor's and the [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu) for my master's, I've honed expertise in computer science, full-stack web development, machine learning, and natural language processing.

My internship at Adobe’s Multimodal Content Lab in 2022 involved developing and patenting a pipeline for enhancing multimodal documents, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver impactful results. Currently, at Coherent as a software engineer, I’ve configured the APISIX API gateway to centralize backend API calls and streamline traffic management. Additionally, I’m developing an AI assistant using OpenAI’s Assistant API with the MEAN stack and TypeScript, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide real-time visualizations and insights on lab incident data. Both internships have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, Express, Nest, React, and Angular.
