This was my course project for the course Principles in Computer Architecture (CSE240A), completed under the guidance of Professor Jishen Zhao, in collaboration with my batchmate Kunind Sahu, during the WI24 of my graduate studies at the University of California, San Diego.
The report for this project is available [here](https://github.com/samyakmehta28/CSE240A/blob/master/Branch_Predictor.pdf) and the code is availabe in the github repository [here](https://github.com/samyakmehta28/CSE240A).

# [Branch Predictor](https://github.com/samyakmehta28/CSE240A)

This project investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of various branch prediction algorithms, namely GShare, Tournament, and Perceptron-based predictors, to enhance processor performance. The primary objective is to assess these predictors' accuracy and efficiency in minimizing mispredictions in branch instructions, thereby reducing pipeline stalls and improving overall computational throughput.

### Introduction:

Branch prediction is a crucial aspect of modern processor architecture, as it allows for speculative execution of instructions and minimizes delays due to branch mispredictions. This project explores three different branch prediction techniques:

- GShare Predictor: Utilizes global branch history to enhance prediction accuracy by leveraging correlations across branches.
- Tournament Predictor: Combines local and global predictors to dynamically choose the most accurate prediction strategy.
- Perceptron-based Predictor: Employs a neural network approach to improve prediction by learning patterns in branch behavior.
  Each predictor is implemented and tested across various benchmark datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Datasets:

- SPEC CPU2006 Benchmarks:
  A suite of industry-standardized benchmarks designed to test the performance of a processor across a variety of computational tasks. These benchmarks are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the branch predictors in real-world scenarios.

- Branch Trace Datasets:
  Custom datasets containing branch instruction traces collected from different applications, used to test the predictors under various branch prediction scenarios.

### Methodology:

The project involves implementing each of the three branch predictors and evaluating their performance using the specified datasets. The methodology includes:

- Implementation of Predictors:

  - GShare: Combining global history with branch address bits to index into a prediction table.
  - Tournament: Utilizing both local and global predictors, with a meta-predictor to select the best prediction.
  - Perceptron: Using a neural network model to make predictions based on historical branch patterns.

- Performance Evaluation:

  - Measuring prediction accuracy, the number of mispredictions, and computational overhead.
  - Comparing the results across different benchmark datasets to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each predictor.

### Key Findings:

- GShare Predictor:
  Achieved high prediction accuracy by effectively leveraging global branch history, but showed limitations in handling highly dynamic branch patterns.

- Tournament Predictor:
  Provided the best overall performance by dynamically selecting between local and global predictions, thus adapting to varying branch behaviors.

- Perceptron-based Predictor:
  Demonstrated promising results in recognizing complex branch patterns but required significant computational resources, which may limit its practicality for real-time applications.

### Analysis and Categorization of Errors:

The errors encountered in branch prediction were categorized as follows:

- Dynamic Branch Patterns: Challenges in predicting branches with highly variable behavior.
- Overhead in Neural Networks: Computational complexity associated with the Perceptron-based predictor.
- Pattern Recognition Limitations: Difficulty in recognizing and predicting highly irregular branch patterns.

### Conclusion:

The project highlights the effectiveness of combining different branch prediction strategies to improve overall prediction accuracy and reduce pipeline stalls. While the GShare and Tournament predictors show robust performance in various scenarios, the Perceptron-based predictor offers potential for future improvements in complex pattern recognition, albeit with higher computational costs.
