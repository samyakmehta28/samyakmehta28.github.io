I created this project as a personal endeavor to learn backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. These technologies form a powerful stack for building scalable web applications. They offer fast performance, real-time capabilities, flexible data modeling, and a vast ecosystem of packages, making them ideal for modern, data-driven web development. The code for these projects can be found in the github repository [here](https://github.com/samyakmehta28/Node_js_projects).

# [Node.js and Express.js Project Suite](https://github.com/samyakmehta28/Node_js_projects)

### Overview:

This project suite comprises three interconnected applications developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Each application addresses specific needs in task management, e-commerce, and job searching, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) in creating robust web applications.

### Projects:

- Task Manager Application

  - Purpose: Efficient organization and tracking of user tasks
  - Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
  - Key Features:
    - User authentication and task ownership
    - CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Task prioritization and categorization
    - RESTful API endpoints for task management

- RESTful Store API

  - Purpose: Seamless interaction with store inventory data
  - Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
  - Key Features:
    - Inventory management with real-time updates
    - Product listing, details, and search functionality
    - Order processing and tracking
    - User authentication for secure transactions

- Job API
  - Purpose: Facilitate job listings and applications
  - Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
  - Key Features:
    - Job posting and management for employers
    - Job search and application system for job seekers
    - User profiles for both employers and applicants
    - Advanced search and filter capabilities

### Technical Details:

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework
- Database: MongoDB for efficient, schema-less data storage
- API Design: RESTful architecture
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions
- Data Validation: Mongoose for schema definition and validation

### Conclusion:

This suite of projects demonstrates proficiency in full-stack JavaScript development using the MERN stack. The Task Manager, Store API, and Job API showcase the ability to create scalable, efficient web applications that address real-world needs. The use of MongoDB allows for flexible data modeling and efficient querying, while Node.js and Express.js provide a robust backend framework for handling complex business logic and API requests.
