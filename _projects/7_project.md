I created this project as a personal endeavor to learn Angular. I learned Angular-18 to deepen my understanding of building dynamic web applications using TypeScript. Its robust framework offers enhanced code reusability, streamlined development, and the ability to handle complex functionalities efficiently. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/samyakmehta28/HotelInventoryApp).

# Hotel Inventory App: A Frontend Project using Angular

### Overview:

The Hotel Inventory App is a frontend application developed using Angular, designed to streamline hotel management and room booking processes. The app features distinct roles for users and admins, providing functionalities for room management, inventory control, and booking services. The project aims to create a user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless interactions for both hotel staff and guests.

### Introduction:

The Hotel Inventory App addresses the need for an efficient and user-centric system for managing hotel operations and room bookings. Traditional methods of room management often involve manual processes, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. The app simplifies these operations by offering a comprehensive digital solution for managing room inventories and booking services. Developed using Angular, the app leverages the framework's capabilities to provide a robust, responsive, and scalable platform.

### Functionalities:

- User and Admin Roles:

  - User Role: Allows guests to browse, view, and book available rooms.
  - Admin Role: Empowers hotel staff to manage room inventories by adding, editing, or removing rooms.

- Room Management:

  - Add/Edit/Delete Rooms: Admins can add new rooms or edit existing ones, specifying details such as room type, availability, and pricing.
  - Inventory Control: The system maintains a real-time inventory of rooms, updating availability based on bookings and modifications by admins.

- Room Booking:

  - View Rooms: Users can view detailed information about available rooms, including descriptions, images, and pricing.
  - Book Rooms: Guests can select desired rooms and make bookings through an intuitive interface, streamlining the reservation process.

### Technical Details:

- The app is built using Angular, a powerful frontend framework that provides a structured approach to web application development. Key technical features include:

- Component-Based Architecture: Modular design with reusable components for room management and booking.
- Two-Way Data Binding: Ensures real-time updates between the user interface and the underlying data models.
- Responsive Design: Adapts to various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across platforms.
- Form Validation: Ensures data integrity by validating user inputs during room management and booking processes.

### Conclusion:

The Hotel Inventory App offers a comprehensive solution for hotel management and room booking, enhancing operational efficiency and user experience. By leveraging Angular's capabilities, the app provides a scalable and robust platform that can be easily extended to include additional features such as payment integration and user reviews. The project demonstrates the potential of modern web technologies in transforming traditional business operations.
