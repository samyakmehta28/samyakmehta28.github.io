I embarked on this team project as part of the final assignment for CSE210: Principles of Software Engineering, under the guidance of Professor Thomas Powell. Our objective was to develop a streamlined, high-performance, browser-based developer tool-kit. We aimed to offer developers convenient access to frequently used tools, eliminating the need for intricate setups or backend dependencies. This strategy ensures swift execution, bolstered security, and a modular design. The project's source code is available in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/cse210-fa24-group4/cse210-fa24-group4).

### Overview:

The project is a web-based developer tool-kit built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It offers a collection of essential developer tools in a single, easy-to-use interface, designed for efficiency and modularity.

### Functionalities:

- Browser-Based:

  - Fully functional in web browsers without installation
  - Fast and responsive user interface

- Modular Design:

  - Each tool functions independently
  - Easy to add or remove tools without affecting others

- Vanilla Implementation:

  - Built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
  - No framework dependencies for improved performance

- Tools available to use:

  - JSON Formatter: Formats JSON data for better readability and structure.
  - UNIX Timestamp Converter: Converts between UNIX timestamps and human-readable date formats.
  - UUID Generator: Generates unique identifiers (UUIDs) for use in various applications.
  - JWT Token Generator: Creates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for secure authentication.
  - URL Encoder/Decoder: Encodes/decodes URLs to ensure proper handling of special characters.

- Security-Focused:
  - No backend to minimize security risks
  - Client-side processing for enhanced data privacy

### Technical Details:

- Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Architecture: Modular, client-side only
- Documentation: JSDoc for comprehensive code documentation
- Testing: End-to-end testing with Playwright and Unit Testing using Jest
- Software Method: Agile methodology with a CI/CD pipeline setup.

### Conclusion:

This project demonstrates proficiency in vanilla web technologies and modular design principles. It showcases the ability to create efficient, browser-based tools that cater to developers' needs without compromising on performance or security. The emphasis on modular architecture and comprehensive testing reflects a robust approach to web application development.
